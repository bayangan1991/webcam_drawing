# Webcam Drawing

Uses the webcam to create drawings based on motion detection and a light pen.

I use the pictionary air pen for this project, but red/green toggleable light source will work.

## Usage

1. Setup with `uv` using `uv sync`
2. Run with `uvicorn main:app --reload`
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`
